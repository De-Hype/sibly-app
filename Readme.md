# Sibly-Chat-App

Sibly-Chat-App is a chat application designed for seamless communication between friends. It consists of two main components: sibly-api and sibly-ui. 

## Features

- **Search Friends:** Users can search for friends within the application to connect and communicate with them.

- **Send and Receive Friend Requests:** Users can send friend requests to others and accept or decline incoming friend requests.

- **Chat with Friends:** Once connected, users can engage in text-based conversations with their friends.

- **Video Call:** Sibly-Chat-App allows users to make video calls to their friends for face-to-face communication.

## Components

### 1. Sibly-API

The `sibly-api` folder contains the backend logic and API endpoints necessary for the application to function. This includes handling user authentication, friend requests, messaging, and video call functionalities.

### 2. Sibly-UI

The `sibly-ui` folder houses the frontend components and user interface elements of the application. It is responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and making requests to the backend API.
